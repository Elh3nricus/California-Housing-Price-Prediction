# California-Housing-Price-Prediction

This project predicts the median house value in California using **machine learning models**. It includes a full **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and the training and evaluation of **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest** models.

## Description
The goal of this project is to understand the dataset, analyze feature relationships, and build predictive models for the median house price.  

The project includes:
- Histograms and boxplots of features
- Correlation matrix analysis
- Feature importance analysis (Random Forest)
- Model evaluation metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²)
- Visualization of Predicted vs Actual house values
